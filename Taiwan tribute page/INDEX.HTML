        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>With legacies as varied as its adventure landscape and spirited traditions thriving alongside the cream of Asian sophistication, Taiwan is a continent on one green island. Taiwan has inherited Chinese traditions of religion and philosophy, as well as that country’s vast literary and aesthetic canon. The island is also a proud heir of the Austronesian culture of its indigenous people. The influences of the Japanese, and to a lesser extent the Dutch and the Spanish are not hard to find either. These rich and varied legacies are what captivate about Taiwan, but even more so is how it succeeded in turning them into an identity as distinctly Taiwanese as Taroko Gorge or a sculpture by Ju Ming. </p>

        <h2>Festivals</h2>
        <p>Taiwan’s cultural calendar bristles with festivals celebrating everything from a god’s birthday to jazz. The country is undoubtedly one of the best places in the world to experience folk and religious festivals – wonderful to behold and involving everyone. A surprising number of young people help out at religious parades. Onlookers are welcome, sometimes even to take part. There’s always a sense of inclusion regardless of faith and never a sense that the proceedings are too sacred for photography. Taiwan is also one of Asia’s cultural capitals. The host of festivals held in the major cities throw light on what the country’s cultural heavyweights are up to. </p>

        <h2>The Beautiful Isle</h2>
        <p>

            Famed for centuries as Ilha Formosa (Beautiful Isle; 美麗島; Měilìdǎo), this is a land with more sides than the 11-headed Guanyin. Towering sea cliffs, marble-walled gorges and tropical forests are just the start of your journey, which could take you as far as Yushan, Taiwan's 3952m alpine roof.In Taiwan you can criss-cross mountains on colonial-era hiking trails or cycle a lone highway with the blue Pacific on one side and green volcanic arcs on the other. And if you simply want a classic landscape to enjoy, you'll find them around every corner. </p>
